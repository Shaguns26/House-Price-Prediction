# House-Price-Prediction
Predicting House Prices using various regression models. I have attempted to predict the pricing of a house based off of datasets from Kaggle.
For this project, I have used the “House Sales in King County, USA” by harlfoxem from Kaggle (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).

I have evaluated the data on 4 regression models:
1) LinearRegression
2) RidgeRegressiom
3) RandomForestRegressor
4) GradientBoostingRegressor

Overview of Submission Folder

This folder contains:

1) The dataset from Kaggle
2) A Jupyter Notebook where I have used regression models to train the data, and predict the pricing of houses in King County, USA
